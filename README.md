Guess the Number game has the following rules before u initialize it :

The 'Secret number' and user guessed number are compared with the following result
If the user guess is greater than or less than 'Secret number' by 10 - the system output is 'Freezy'
If the user guess is + / - 10 from the 'Secret number' - the system output is 'Hot'
If the user guess matches the 'Secret number' - the system prompts 'You guessed it right!!'
The user could suggest iteratively untill it guessed the number 'Right'
